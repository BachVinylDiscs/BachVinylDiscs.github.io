		<h2>Why is this my favorite movie?</h2>
		<p>It's my favorite because I watched it often as a toddler. We have it in videocassette form at home, so there are good memories of putting into the VCR.<br>I like the cartoon-ish form, the background music, and the songs sung by the monkeys.</p>
		<h2>Favorite Singer</h2>
		<p>My favorite actor (well, singer here) is Phil Harris, who sings "Bare Necessities" by Baloo, the bear. It's a catchy song, and it captures his supposed opinion on how to live.</p>
